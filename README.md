Secludedness
================================
Secludedness is a cross-platform game build with [libgdx](libgdx.badlogicgames.com). For further information see my [Webpage/Blog](http://dbaelz.de).

Build
-------------
Secludedness uses Gradle with the [libgdx-gradle-template](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-gradle-template) as build tool. Currently only Secludedness (core project), Secludedness-desktop and Secludedness-android are built. For Secludedness-html (with GWT) see the [GWT website](http://www.gwtproject.org/) and the [libgdx documentation](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation.html).

The projects can be build with the integrated Gradle Wrapper (Gradle 1.7). There is an issue with [Gradle 1.8](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-gradle-template/issues/4), which should be fixed soon. See [libgdx-gradle-template](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-gradle-template) for usage of the wrapper.
